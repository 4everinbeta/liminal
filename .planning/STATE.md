### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AI suggests, user overrides (Leverage LLM for smart defaults while preserving user agency)
- Capture-first, refine-later (Reduce friction at moment of thought capture)
- Gamification for momentum (Streaks and visual progress create sustained engagement)
