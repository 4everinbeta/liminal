## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Urgency over importance (ADHD brains respond to NOW/NOT NOW, not priority rankings)
- AI suggests, user overrides (Leverage LLM for smart defaults while preserving user agency)
- Capture-first, refine-later (Reduce friction at moment of thought capture)
- Gamification for momentum (Streaks and visual progress create sustained engagement)
- Simplify scoring system (Replace abstract 1-100 scores with natural language or auto-calc)

**From 02-02:**
- Use canvas-confetti over custom CSS animations for GPU acceleration (02-02)
- Build custom keyboard shortcut hook instead of react-hotkeys-hook to avoid unnecessary dependency (02-02)
- Treat Cmd and Ctrl as equivalent for cross-platform keyboard shortcuts (02-02)
- Prevent shortcuts from triggering in input fields except those marked with data-quick-capture (02-02)
