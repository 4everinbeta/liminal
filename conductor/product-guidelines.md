# Product Guidelines: Liminal

## Prose Style: Empathetic & Friendly
- Use warm, encouraging language in the interface and notifications.
- Avoid critical or shame-inducing copy (e.g., instead of "You missed your deadline," use "Let's find a better time for this task").
- Documentation should be supportive and easy to digest, assuming the user might be currently overwhelmed.

## Branding & Tone: Calm & Focused
- The overall brand should project a sense of stability and control.
- Avoid cluttered layouts or aggressive marketing "hustle" language.
- Every interaction should aim to lower the user's stress levels and help them find their "flow" state.

## UX Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide complex settings or advanced metadata until the user explicitly requests them. Keep the primary capture and focus views extremely simple.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provide satisfying visual cues (animations, confetti, color shifts) for every task completion or status change. Ensure the UI feels alive and responsive.
- **Forgiveness by Design:** Every action should be easily reversible. Mistakes are expected and should be trivial to fix. Use "Undo" banners and non-destructive deletion.

## Visual Aesthetic: Clean & Airy
- Prioritize whitespace and soft, muted colors to reduce visual noise.
- Use subtle shadows and large, legible typography.
- Avoid high-density information displays; allow elements to "breath" on the screen.
