# Product Definition: Liminal

## Vision
Liminal is an ADHD-optimized productivity system designed to reduce cognitive load and create momentum through urgency and immediate feedback. It aims to replace traditional, static todo lists with a dynamic, AI-powered interface that "nudges" users toward focus.

## Target Audience
- Neurodiverse individuals, specifically those with ADHD.
- People struggling with executive dysfunction.
- Users who find traditional project management tools overwhelming or non-rewarding.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Immediate Dopamine Hits:** Visual celebrations and progress tracking to reinforce completion.
- **Forgiving Workflow:** Easy recovery from interruptions and flexible rescheduling.

## Key Features
- **Focus Mode:** A single-task view with integrated Pomodoro timer and environmental noise control.
- **Quick Capture:** A persistent, LLM-powered chat intake for natural language task creation.
- **Urgency Visualization:** Visual cues (gradients, aging) that indicate task pressure without causing shame.
- **AI Coach:** Natural language interface for prioritizing tasks and breaking down complex goals.
- **Strategic Layers:** Themes and Initiatives to provide context without cluttering the daily view.

## Success Metrics
